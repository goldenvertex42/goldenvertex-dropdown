# dropdown-menu
A reusable dropdown menu using html, css, and javascript

HOW TO USE:

You'll want to have at least one template set up in your HTML(you should be able to use as many as you want) of: 
- a div with the class of "dropdown", 
- inside of this "dropdown" div you'll have a button with the class of "dropdown-btn," 
- and another div with the class of "dropdown-content"
- inside of the dropdown content you'll use anchor tags(if you'd like them to be something else, you can just modify the html and css and the javascript should still work). 

The package is meant to be customizable. You have access to all of the src directory for modification.

Once installed, import the package for side effects by using the ESM syntax "import 'goldenvertex-dropdown'" as well as importing the svg with the path "../node_modules/goldenvertex-dropdown/src/assets/menu.svg" and your dropdown menus should work!
